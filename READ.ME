WARNING: I created this game in Java, and as such there are issues with the game. These are above my level of expertise to fix.
Java is not designed for games. Especially with up to 10k iterations a second on a single scene.
The program is also threaded which may streamline performance but does increase the load on the CPU.

The bonus of this massive initial CPU usage is that the usage never really increases.

I am trying as much as possible to reduce the CPU usage but it's not easy. Keep that in mind. This is also a Alpha.
